# Tic-tac-toe
# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

A simple graphical Tic-Tac-Toe game built using Python's `tkinter` library. This project demonstrates basic GUI development and game logic, including the tracking of game states.

## Features

* **Classic 3x3 Grid:** Play the traditional Tic-Tac-Toe game.
* **Player Turns:** Alternates between 'X' and 'O'.
* **Win/Tie Detection:** Automatically identifies winning conditions and ties.
* **Game State Tracking:** Logs the board's state after each move, printed to the console at the end of a game.
* **Reset Functionality:** Easily restart the game after it concludes.

## Setup and Installation

To run this game, you'll need Python installed on your system. `tkinter` is usually included with standard Python distributions, so no additional `pip` installations should be necessary.

1.  **Clone the repository (or download the `tic_tac_toe.py` file):**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/Tic-Tac-Toe-Game.git](https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/Tic-Tac-Toe-Game.git)
    cd Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
    ```
    (Remember to replace `YourGitHubUsername/Tic-Tac-Toe-Game` with your actual repository path if you're setting up a new repo.)

2.  **No external dependencies:**
    This project primarily uses Python's built-in `tkinter` library. Therefore, there are no specific `pip install` steps for external libraries.

## How to Run

Navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run the Python script:

```bash
python tic_tac_toe.py
